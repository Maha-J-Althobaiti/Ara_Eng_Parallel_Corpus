## Arabic-English Parallel Corpus


We used a comparable corpus to automatically construct a parallel corpus between Arabic and English.

We utilised Arabic and English Wikipedia, a free source of comparable corpus. The resulting Arabic-English corpus consists of 105,010 parallel sentences with a total number of 4.6M words.
